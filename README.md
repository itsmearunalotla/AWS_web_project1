🖥️ On the Offline Server:
Run the installation with:

bash
Copy
Edit
.\vs_BuildTools.exe --noweb --norestart --in .\Response.json --log .\install.log
Make sure Response.json is present in the same folder or adjust the path.

✅ Optional: Manually Import Certificates (if layout recreation isn't feasible)
If re-creating layout is not possible, then:

Export Microsoft root/intermediate certs from a working PC (with certmgr.msc).

Import them into Trusted Root Certification Authorities on the offline server using certmgr.msc or PowerShell.

But re-creating the layout is cleaner and more reliable.

Would you like step-by-step help with:

Exporting/importing certs?

Recreating the layout with specific workloads?

Let me know how you'd prefer to proceed.
